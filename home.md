# PERSONAL SECURITY
Many gun owners, when asked, will cite personal security as their main reason for owning a firearm. Choosing a firearm is a personal choice.  What is your main reason for purchasing a firearm? Are you able to manipulate the firearm? Is it comfortable for your size and hand structure?  Do you intend to conceal carry it or will it remain locked in a safe/case until it’s needed (or until your next practice session at our indoor range)? These are all questions that you, and only you, can answer when selecting a firearm. You may own a firearm and never have to use it for the protection of yourself or your family members just as you may have vehicle or homeowners insurance and never file a claim but in the event that you needed it, wouldn’t you prefer to be prepared? We are happy to help guide you and answer any additional questions you may have in your decision-making process.

# TRAINING
At Stage Stop Gun Shop, we not only support your 2nd amendment right to own a firearm but we also offer training courses to assist you to not only be comfortable with using your firearm but also how to use it properly.  Training is an important responsibility of firearm ownership.  We will begin offering CCW training and will eventually add first time buyer training as well as some specialty training so stay tuned for updates!

# INDOOR RANGE
Welcome to our state of the art indoor range.  We have a total of 20 lanes - 8 lanes at 15 yds for pistols, 6 lanes at 20 yds and 6 lanes at 25 yds available for you to shoot your firearm with a caliber up to .308.  We also rent firearms for use in our range.   We will be introducing a MILO system in our range which offers interactive Use of Force and firearms training.  The advantage of a true graphic environment for firearms drills and exercises is the increased timing and target accuracy and free-form target interaction.  We offer a superior ventilation system that will direct the air down range to prevent lead exposure and ensure that you are always breathing clean air.  Memberships are available in yearly or monthly packages or you can rent a lane for the hourly rate.
